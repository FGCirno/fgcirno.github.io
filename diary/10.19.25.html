                  Time</b></u></h2>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
              I‚Äôve been thinking lately about places I can never return to. There‚Äôs so many different places I‚Äôve been
              to in my life; houses of family friends that my grandmother would take me along to when I was a kid. Old
              places I used to live in where everyone I knew from then is now dead, or houses that burned completely to
              the ground. Places where I would have no logical way to get back to. The people who I could get more info
              from are long dead. So all I have is my memories of these places. Memories to document here.</p>


            <!-- <figure class="figureright">
              <img src="https://i.imgur.com/RArro7h.png" class="figimg">
              <figcaption style="caption-side: bottom;">Gen 4 Pokedex Toy like the one I had as a kid.</figcaption>
            </figure> -->


            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">I can imagine one of these houses I visited when I was in middle school. Me
              and my friend at the time
              were left alone in this middle class apartment, pretending to be Pokemon and playing with a Pokedex toy we
              just got (it was around the time of Gen 4 so it was a replica of Ash's Pokedex from that generation).
              I have many memories from that one day I spent in that house with my friend, of his Mom coming home from
              work after leaving us there alone to play all we wanted to til she arrived and made dinner. It's funny.
              I can't remember anything about that friend, their name, their face or anything. I simply have this
              heartkept
              memory of the time I spent at his house.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Similarly, I can recall different visions of a sprawling, circular miniature
              mansion. I must have visited
              there when I was just in high school.
              I can recall a massive carpeted stairway leading up to the room where I first played Halo Reach and
              Prototype on the 360 (though my friend hogged the game). There was a bar just down the stairs where my
              grandmother would spend all her time
              with her friend. A dark bedroom just past the main living room where so many childhood memories of mine
              lay. I can still remember the moons light shimmering through the blinds. Like I mentioned before, I can
              hardly
              recall my friend, and their name. I can remember their face a bit better than my other friend from my
              earlier childhood
              memory but still. It's a bit sad that even though I can remember these memories of this place so clearly,
              the people tied to them are so distant to me.</p>



            <p>On a less grim note is the room I spent many of my high school years in. My
              friend had a setup I was
              always so
              envious of, this cool attic bedroom with two beds with memory foam you‚Äôd just sink into, a big flatscreen
              TV, a PS4 when I
              didn‚Äôt have one, a really powerful sports fan that sat on the floor and a full 12 pack of the nicest,
              cheapest dollar
              store cans of soda you could find. I played Bloodborne for the first time in that room, and I remember
              vividly my memories of the Blood-starved Beast and Vicar Amelia. I remember being told by my friend ‚ÄúYou
              know you sit up in your sleep, right?‚Äù. I recall watching our other friend play through Dark Souls 1 late
              into the night there, and hearing with a warm heart him share his thoughts on the game with me. In the
              end, her family had to sell the house when her grandfather
              passed due to cancer.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Most importantly to this discussion, I remember the many houses I‚Äôve lived
              in throughout my
              life.
              I remember living in
              Oakhurst, CA during an
              interim
              time when my Grandmother just passed away. It was the house she owned, and I was living there alongside
              her until her final moments. When she passed away, I was left to care for it alone so my memories of that
              place take on an entirely different meaning now. I remember my different apartments I‚Äôve lived in in
              France. This small cramped space me and my boyfriend would share, but spend our time wishing for
              better. Knowing that space is now unoccupied, or at the very least occupied by a completely different
              tennant is a very peculiar feeling, a sort of acknowledgement of object perminance but towards a space
              instead of a single object. I
              remember moving back into my childhood home, and finding it to be completely different having been away
              for 10 years. Though I had been gone, my uncles, my cousins and those still there continued to live long
              lives. Time changes everything, and those places you hold dear will be as different as you are when
              you return.</p>

            </figure>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">The trailer my Grandma and I shared when we had to move away from my
              childhood home is the memory I hold
              dearest. I can still remember my room, the rigidity of the wall, how if you weren‚Äôt careful you could cut
              yourself on the cheap material each wall was made out of. My massive CRT next to the door. My dresser I
              kept everything I owned in, more than just clothing I kept video games, photo books, everything in there.
              The closet I turned into a little desk space when I built my first desktop.
              The black mitt styled chair that I spent so many hours napping under the sun in. The wooden futon I‚Äôd
              sleep on when not using that chair. I remember the washing machine in the hallway. The small, dark
              bathroom. My grandma‚Äôs room closest to the exit. Hell, I remember being alone at night and sometimes
              feeling scared knowing anyone could break in at any time with how weak the lock were, but no one ever did.
            </p>



            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">That house burned down when I'd just become an adult. Still, I remember all
              of
              the good, and the bad in my life living there. I
              never got to wash the dishes before the fire happened, and I can picture that full sink in my head to this
              day, a sort of scar on my mind and a smudge of darkness inbetween many good memories. Likewise, I have a
              lot of bad memories involving my family in that house. It's simply a part of remembering that place that
              is special to me in the now distant future. Equally
              fresh in my mind is the beautiful carpet in the living room and the most
              comfortable couch I‚Äôve ever sat on. I remember the hell my grandmother often put me through. I also
              remember inviting friends over, or working out on the
              treadmill on our patio. There are so many clear memories of me learning how to wear makeup for the first
              time, or ordering a wig in solidarity, and giving my grandma hints that I wasn't comfortable with my
              gender. I wasn't ready to crack my egg yet, but I have to wonder if she knew. Regardless of how much we
              fought, she said she would always support me no matter what.</p>

            <p>I can‚Äôt ever go back to that place. Even if I could, it wouldn‚Äôt be my house
              anymore. Still, my memories
              of that place are very special to me. Any time I feel homesick, all I need to do is reminisce and I‚Äôll
              feel all better. I miss my grandma dearly, and I miss the house we shared for years even if times weren‚Äôt
              always great in it. Part of me wishes I took more photographs. I can recall so vividly the room I grew up
              in, but I have so little to show of it. It wasn‚Äôt anything special, I mean it was literally a mobile home,
              but that‚Äôs fine. It means a lot to me now, that it‚Äôs gone and there‚Äôs no going back. The places we go in
              life are so significant, but we can‚Äôt appreciate them til we‚Äôre gone.</p>
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">All these places I've lived in throughout my life live on, in my mind. The trailer I grew up in may have burned down in 2018, but I still dream about it often. In those dreams, I meet my Grandmother, and there's an equal surprise that she's alive and our house is still fine as there is a warmth to being home again, for the first time in a very, very long time. The places I've lived have made me. They've molded me into the woman I am today. I wouldn't be who I am right now, for better or worse, if I didn't have all of these experience both fond and hurtful.</p>

              <img src="https://ssl.cdn-redfin.com/photo/45/bigphoto/945/PA200706945_2_1.jpg" class="figimg">
              <figcaption style="caption-side: bottom;">One of the only pictures I have of my house that burned down,
                unfurnished and before we
                moved in.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">It's sad that I can't return to the trailer where I grew up, or the childhood home that I remember, or all of these apartments that simply belong to someone else now. But in accepting that fact, that these spaces belong to someone else and that person is making memories there makes me content. After all, the memories I hold of all these places I've been throughout my life mean the world to me. If someone else gets to have the same defining experiences then it's okay if I never get to see any of these beloved spots ever again. My memories of them will carry me into a bright future.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">So all I can really say is appreciate what you have while you have it. I certainly had no idea while living in these special places that one day would be my last, and you likely won't either. Value the space you have in this world and what that space means for you. Likewise if you love someone, show them that love unconditionally.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;"> Time's are tough and we're all limited on it, so make the most with the time you have. Thank you so much for reading.</p>
