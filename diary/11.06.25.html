            <h2 style="color: orange;  text-align: center; font-family: Renogare;">When Minerva and Bell Went to Paris - A Travel Blog</h2>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">I went to Paris in 2024 for both the NieR Orchestral Concert in February
              2024 and then later for the Sonic Symphony at Le Grand Rex later in June. While it's been a little bit since
              then, this website didn't exist when I took these trips. So I'll go ahead and catalog my journey for you
              here.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">We booked for our trip well in advance, securing the tickets for both the Nier Orchestra 
              as well as the Sonic Symphony as soon as they became available. I knew after hearing a lot of praise from the first showings
              of the Sonic Symphony that I needed to go there as soon as I could, so I jumped at the opportunity as soon as I heard that
              they were doing a 2023 showing in Paris. Well, as stated above the showing got pushed back to the middle of 2024. It wasn't too 
              much of a big deal, but it was a shame to hear that the first planned showing was so poorly thought out that they had to push it 
              back over half a year. Bell and I didn't find out until down to the wire, we didn't get an email or anything, we simply had to check
              the social media for the Sonic Symphony specifically to find out. We very nearly ended up booking a trip to Paris that would've just been
              a huge waste of money, but we got lucky.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">With the Sonic Symphony pushed back to after the Nier Concert, we started planning our trip for the latter instead.
              About a week before the venue would open, we booked two seats next to each other on a train to Paris, early in the morning. We booked a hotel at a 
              convenient location with check in set for noon so we could show up and drop our stuff off right away. With that, we were prepared to head out as soon 
              as was reasonable.
            </p>

            <figure class="figureright">

              <figcaption style="caption-side: bottom;">Riding the train from Marseille towards Paris!</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">We arrived in Paris the day before the orchestra was set, February 22nd. Since
              We live in Marseille we decided to take the train from Gare de Marseille-Saint-Charles to Gare de Lyon. 
              Boarding the train was hectic and very stress inducing because we couldn't find the right cabin and got 
              approached by strangers telling us to move out of what we thought was our seat, but once we found our seat proper it was a nice time. 
              For basically the entire trip I tried to relax, and catch up on some Anime on my Phone when I wasn't taking in the sights.
              Southern France is filled with beautiful, grassy hills.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">When we arrived in Paris, the first thing we did was take a metro towards our Hotel.
              While grabbing the tickets I was overly conscious of being robbed. We packed light, just a backpack for each of us
              and I was certain someone could snoop in my stuff if they wanted to. My backpack is <a href="https://us.super-groupies.com/products/basil-model-backpack-omori" target="blank">the Basil themed one Omocat produced
              with SuperGroupies</a> that doesn't have a proper zipper, just a button. That said, nothing got stolen. Still, can't be too
              careful in Paris.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">The metro cart we got was really cool, way more nifty than the ones in Marseille.
              It was a two story tram with a lot of room to stand, basically built to accommodate for the high amounts of traffic
              and tourism that a city like Paris brings in. All that said, while I found the metro to be very impressive even as
              someone who already loves Marseille's transit, I was still sweating my butt off about being robbed at this moment
              so while I was actually in the metro I couldn't enjoy it to its fullest.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Finally, we got to our destination, the Charles de Gaulle - Etoile station. We found
              the hotel we booked ahead of time and checked in. Finally, I was freed from my (probably overstated) fear of being
              robbed thanks to being able to leave my bag in the hotel. The day was overcast and quite rainy, but now that we were
              free of our baggage and had somewhere to return to for the night, I pushed for us to go out and explore the city.
              Really try to make the most of what we had there.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">So our first step was l'Arc de Triomphe. Being a block over, about a 5 minute walk from
               our hotel this was our first priority. We didn't bother to cross the street in order to get a close look at l'Arc but
              even from the distance we had to look at it, it was very majestic. Easy to tell immediately why it's a well renowned
              monument representing France as a whole really. It stands tall as a symbol of France's many militant victories, and
              its placement at the center of a branching series of artery roads really makes it feel like the heart of Paris, even
              more than the Eiffel Tower.
            </p>

            <figure class="figureleft">
              <img src="../img/paris/2.jpg" class="figimg2" draggable="false" onclick="window.open(this.src)">
              <figcaption style="caption-side: bottom;">l'Arc de Triomphe, picture taken by Bell from our trip, in front of a cloudy backdrop.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Speaking of, that's where we headed next. We ended up taking a bus, another two story
              vehicle much like the metro we took and they dropped us off a short distance away from the Tower. I admired it for 
              a while from the distance, just kind of letting it set in that I was in front of this icon of French culture for the first 
              and maybe last time in my life. Like l'Arc, we couldn't get close to the Tower but seeing it from the distance we were at, where
              it hung over is so majestically that we had to crane our necks to see the top of it was breathtaking on its own.
            </p>

            <br clear="left">

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
              But after some time, we had moved past the Eiffel Tower. We walked along the body of water near us. I didn't know 
              at the time but we were walking along the south east bank Seine River, nearest the Eiffel Tower. There were a good amount
              of fancy looking sea-bound restaurants, set up on big boats to our right as we walked south along the Seine bank. 
              We were kind of aimless, more so taking in the environment more than anything but that's how it should be I think.
              Just taking everything in as we go.
            </p>

           

            <figure class="figure">

              <figcaption style="caption-side: bottom;">The Seine River. In the distance on the left is the Bir-Hakeim Monument and to the right is the residential area we would explore. Off camera to the left is the Eiffel Tower.</figcaption>

              <figcaption style="caption-side: bottom;">Some interesting looking boats alongside the Seine Riverside. I thought they looked cool so I wanted to take a picture of them.</figcaption>

            <br clear="left">
          

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Making it to the end of our journey along the bank, we headed up some stairs and found
              a bronze statue acting as a monument to honor the Battle of Bir Hakeim. It's a statue of a General riding on horseback and 
              carrying a sword in his right hand, and a flag in his left, seemingly rallying his troops forwards. It's a very evocative image
              and it's modeled in a fashion that is very, very expressive. The General and his horse share a line of action, acting as one in 
              a way that conveys their strength.
            </p>
            

            <figure class="figure" style="width: 50%;">

              <figcaption style="caption-side: bottom;">The Monument for the Battle of Bir-Hakeim, rusted with age and exposure. Backed by a cloudy skyline.</figcaption>

            <br clear="left">

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Contrasting that, to the due east of the statue seemed to be la Maison de la culture du Japon à Paris
              with a big ol advertisement right next to the building declaring "Un an avec Tora-san", a poster advertising the French preservation
              (and I assume screening?) of a series of Japanese films from the 1970s known as "Otoko wa Tsurai yo (男はつらいよ)", nicknamed Tora-san
              after the main character of the series Torajirō Kuruma (hence the French moniker on the advertisement, "Un an avec Tora-san"). I was equally amused as I was 
              happy to see something like a Japanese Culture House in Paris. It's wonderful to see a culture I adore embraced by like-minded people
              all over the world.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">We walked around for a bit more, making our way down towards the other side of the river and into a bit
              of a residential area, just kind of walking around aimlessly and trying to see all that we could see. I was amazed that so much of the
              street design and architecture reminded me of places I grew up in. The San Francisco Bay Area and surrounding locales. Big cities with
              tightly packed alley ways and a sort of chill vibe, highways hanging overhead as you walk the streets and little businesses scattered across
              the residence. We wound up at a different metro, fully outdoors and just not many people hanging out. It was cozy, keeping in mind that
              it was near raining and we were freezing our butts off in our jackets. But still, a very comfortable and homely feeling metro.

            <br clear="left">

            <p>With time, 
              our sightseeing was over. We headed back to our hotel and prepared ourselves for the orchestra later that night, the whole reason
              we came to Paris in the first place.</p>

            <div><img src="../img/bgs/purpledivider.png" style="height: 8px; width: 100%"></div>

            <img src="../img/paris/niersymp.png" style="max-height: 170px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Nier Orchestra Concert">

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">We got back to the hotel room and waited for night time when the concert was meant to happen, then we headed out about 2
              hours ahead of schedule. We got there and... we were the only ones there. It was completely empty, and we couldn't find the entrance. I wondered if we
              were just too early but... no. I made a scheduling mistake, and we were an entire day early somehow. I beat myself up over it a lot, but Bell kept assuring
              me things would be fine. We booked another day for our hotel stay to let us sleep after the concert the next day, and that was that. We went back home and rested up.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">After a night of well deserved rest, we headed back to the venue that the NieR concert was being held in:
              the beautiful Palais des Congrès Amphitheater. The walk there wasn't too bad.
              We ended up being later than when we headed there the day before, only showing up about 30 minutes before the concert, and because of that we got to the back of a line that circled around
              the whole building. It felt like it took forever to get seated from the line, in reality it was only about half an hour so it wasn't as 
              bad as it could've been. The real kicker in being late was the fact that just about all of the merch was sold out. All we could get was 
              two shirts from the event, mine was too small for me then and is especially so now (I should really work on my weight ;;).
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">We got seated on one of the higher rows, far away from the performance. I figured when ordering our tickets
              that Bell wouldn't mind too much (hoping that was true, he never really commented on it) and I certainly was willing to compromise to
              guarantee I could get a ticket at all, with how quickly they sold out. That being said, it means that my photos and videos from the
              event aren't as high resolution as I would want.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Throughout the orchestra performed by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra led by Eric Roth, we were greeted by the special guests for the evening, among them being the NieR vocalists
              Emi Evans and J'nique Nicole in these beautiful matching blue and red dresses. Hearing them live, eventually doing a duet together for Song of the Ancients was a sight to behold. In addition to that
              composer Keiichi Okabe came on at the end of the concert to share some words of thanks and all I could feel was a strong passion, a disbelief and reverence
              being in the same room as these three legends who have made countless completely evocative pieces of music that have utterly filled my empty soul with
              joy. I felt unworthy, but at the same time just amazed that I could breathe the same air as them. It was truly breathtaking. In that moment, I had a brief
              thought of wishing I could have gotten closer seats, but c'est la vie. I am simply happy I could go to the event at all.
            </p>

            <figure class="figureleft">
              <img src="../img/paris/9.jpg" class="figimg2" draggable="false" onclick="window.open(this.src)">
              <figcaption style="caption-side: bottom;">Eric Roth, Emi Evans, J'nique Nicole, and the symphonic orchestra taking a bow at the end of the concert.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">For those unaware, the whole concert is told from the perspective of 2B and 9S after the events of NieR Automata's Ending D.
              The story of the concert is told both as short intermissions between each track as well as voiceless, text-only narration on screen meant to synchronize with
              the live orchestra. Its presentation is impeccable, letting you absorb the weight of the story you're being told alongside the passion and mastery of the
              live orchestra you are hearing. The general plot is basically a celebration of your love of the NieR franchise, with 2B and 9S finding a place called Eden
              that is a sort of bunker for the surreal. It seems to expand downwards eternally, and we're presented with plenty of familiar locations which act as the
              impetus for the music we're hearing. Stuff like Emil's Mansion when they play Emil's theme, or the Shadowlord's Castle for his theme. 
            </p>

            

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">It is purely fanservice, but it shouldn't be anything more than that. Yet the narrative of the orchestra happens to have
              the same sorts of twists and turns you'd expect from any Yoko Taro game. 2B realizes her black box is still damaged from the events of Automata, ultimately
              breaking down before being saved by a "black sphere" which crumples upon healing her. I took this immediately to be a Seed of Destruction and if you know anything
              about those from Drakengard, I don't even have to tell you that revelation made me gulp, and my throat practically ended up in my stomach. So, yeah pretty fun narrative
              in its own regard. It takes a lot of advantage of the medium it's being told in, and it feels like they gave us something with substance that wasn't too hard to parse given 
              the limited time-frame. Yoko Taro clearly has plenty of experience in this medium from all of the stage plays and musicals he's directed the stories for in the past.
            </p>

            

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">I'm not a musician, but I think it would be impossible to talk about this trip and the experience of going to Paris
              for the sake of a concert without talking about the concert itself. Over all, the set-list was fantastic. Bell and I are both big fans of the original NieR so the appearance
              of songs from that game, notably Snow in Summer, Gods Bound by Rules, and ESPECIALLY Shadowlord made us incredibly happy. I was practically bouncing up and down in my seat
              when I saw the word Shadowlord appear on the screen, and when I heard it was A FREAKING TRUMPET COVER OF A USUALLY DRUM HEAVY SONG THAT I LOVED, man, indescribable. Shadowlord 
              was the finale for the first act of the show, and afterwards there was a 20 minute intermission and it felt so fitting, it felt like I, as a fan, with my tastes and my adoration
              of that character and his amazing music was being pandered to specifically and it was an indescribably great experience.
            </p>

            

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Much of the Automata music was of the same calibur. I don't think I have the same connection to any song in Automata as I do for Shadowlord aside
              from maybe Voice of No Return, but at the same time the arranged versions of the OST that the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra performed was fantastic. I personally don't know if I 
              would have picked "A Beautiful Song" from the Automata soundtrack for a set-list if I could only pick a certain number of songs, but I mean you listen to that song once and you go
              "Oh, yeah, of course they would perform an honest version of this in a live orchestra. You'd have to be mad to think otherwise" which, yeah. It is an INCREDIBLE song for a live 
              orchestral performance.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">After Sound of the End (very fitting considering its near penultimate place in the Automata OST) The concert set ended with a duet of Emi and 
              J'nique singing Ashes of Dreams, the credits song from the original NieR. It was PERFECT. Absolutely serene. They delicately yet professionally traded verses back and forth
              J'nique's singing voice isn't one you'd be used to for this song as Emi was the sole singer before but she ABSOLUTELY nails it. So much so, it is easily my new favorite version
              of this song. I can't give high enough praise to both Emi and J'nique for their fantastic performance here, definitely the standout for this track. But then... We got one more song
              from them to close out the concert. A melancholic and quiet version of Weight of the World. An incredibly somber and impactful way to end the concert. I truly can't praise it enough.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">With the performance finished, all the guests of honor took the stage as the lights came on. Emi Evans, J'nique Nicole, Keiichi Okabe (with an Emil head 
              saying Yoko Taro is there in spirit), Yosuke Saito and Eric Roth took a bow, thanking everyone for being there and hoping they had an unforgettable night. Saying their peace in both 
              English and French and exiting the stage to a rancorous round of applause. 
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Once the concert was finished after about a two hour runtime, we were ushered out of the amphitheater where we could just talk with one another about
              how amazing the experience was. How we were surprised by what tracks showed up and the quality of their arrangements. We walked around the Paris nightlife
              for a bit, deciding on food. We went simple with McDonalds, and I got to be equally amazed at the quality difference between Californian, Marseille and Paris
              Fast Food. I don't think it would've been my first choice for a nice outing, but at the same time having the knowledge that McDonalds tastes so different even
              within the same country is nice. We headed back to the hotel and spent our last night in Paris in a restful silence.
            </p>

            <p>Then, we were trainwards bound for home.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Four months later we came back to Paris for the Sonic Symphony. We got there bright and early just like before, but this time we had planned
              to only stay there the day of the concert as Bell had to get back to work.
            </p>

            </figure>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">We arrived at the concert venue and got a spot in line. I think we got to cheat the line because the security staff ended up placing us ahead 
              of people who were already waiting, but who am I to complain. We got inside eventually, and walked through the cinema, seeing rows of merchandise on sale. Bell and I stopped,
              we each got a T-Shirt (again a size too small for me) and I got a magnet which now sits on my PC case. We made our way up the stairs of the venue to a concession stand. Bell buys 
              us a popcorn to share and some sodas. We head towards the theater and learn our seats had to be modified for safety concerns relating to the speaker, but in the end our seats ended
              up closer because of that, up on the balcony about two rows from the edge of the balcony.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">We find our seats, and we're greeted to a fanart and cosplay showcase with some ambient music, followed by a
              20 minute countdown until the concert begins. Bell and I take the time to get comfortable. For this entire show, the crowd was incredibly hyped up.
              I noticed a lot more Americans for this showing than the NieR concert, the peak example of which being when the countdown was almost finished the crowd erupted in "FIVE! FOUR! THREE!"
              where as just under that you could hear "TROIS! DOUX! UN!". It's a bit sad in a way, that this showing was mostly tourists (my poser butt included), but I suppose that's just
              the type of draw that Sonic has. It's definitely worldwide, I've met more than my fair share of Sonic fans in France but still, it's definitely a series that appeals heavily to Americans.
            </p>

            <p>While we were waiting I decided to check my 3DS and noticed the green LED lighting up, indicating that I got a Streetpass. I open it and wouldn't you know, there
              were 6 others who brought their 3DS with them for the exact same reason I did. It's really cool how even with the 3DS made completely obsolete and the Nintendo Network 
              for it having long shut down, you can still have these great interactions.
            </p>

            <br clear="left">

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">The first act of the concert was basically what I expected going in. It was pretty much just a live version of the 30th Anniversary setlist and I was
              completely happy with that. That's exactly the experience I paid for, to hear this album that brought me nearly to tears years ago at that point but live and I was completely content with
              that. Hearing all of the medleys live, and with speakers that were notably stronger than the ones from the NieR orchestra was quite impactful. Notably, the orchestral cover of Believe in Myself 
              + It Doesn't Matter really hit hard and got me thinking about how my whole life up to this point lead me to this moment in this auditorium, feeling this strongly. 
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">The use of well edited video
              alongside the live orchestra was just as masterful as the NieR concert, but without directly telling a sprawling narrative. It's amazing how you can have these two orchestra use similar technique
              equally masterfully and get completely different results. The first act ended with a brand new medley of Sonic Frontiers, which wasn't out when the 30th Anniversary Symphony happened and it really just felt like 
              I was living through something special. The concert went on a short intermission, and came back with an absolute bang.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">The completely unexpected surprise this time around was that the second half of the concert we all thought was just a symphony was a straight up rock concert,
              one befitting the titular "Year of Shadow" that was 2024. It opened IMMEDIATELY with the all too familiar electric guitar cords of I Am All of Me and the crowd LOST THEIR MIND. At the head of this concert 
              was none other than the legend Tomoya Ohtani himself on guitar, and Casey Lee Williams of all people showing up as a guest singer! We didn't know she'd be in Shadow Generations at this point, 
              so seeing the singer for RWBY show up to perform for this was ANOTHER huge shock on top of the fact that my SYMPHONY turned into a ROCK CONCERT. It was unspeakably hype, and the room was 
              completely inconsolable in the best way.
            </p>

            <figure class="figureright">

              <figcaption style="caption-side: bottom;">The countdown to the concert.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">In addition to Ohtani and Williams, there was Shoto Nakama on Guitar and male vocals and he along with the other musicians did a fantastic job.
              The setlist aside from I Am All of Me included songs like Unknown from M.E., His World, Fist Bump and it's like each song got more and more energetic somehow. I can't describe it in any
              other way than it made my life better getting to go to this event. It made me feel so happy to be a Sonic fan, like any sort of doubts I may have had about loving this series were completely washed away.
              It was intoxicating.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">At the end of the set was I'm Here from Sonic Frontiers and it was perfect, everything I could've ever wanted. THE perfect song to end things with and 
              the bands version of it was just phenomenal. Casey, Tomoya and the others exited stage left and the crowd erupted, cheering "WE WANT MORE! WE WANT MORE!" and we got just that. They finished 
              off the set with Escape from the City, Live and Learn and finally as a premier just for Paris: One Way Dream. An acknowledgement of what everyone in the venue loves about Sonic, and a bold affirmation that he's a spark that 
              just won't go out. The future ahead is bright. My words don't do it justice, this concert, its musicians and staff and technical artists, and the crowd were unbelievably amazing.

            </figure>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">In the end, I don't think I could say either concert experience was better. They both have their own strengths. The NieR concert told its own story and was more of what I expected 
              out of a symphony being incredibly impressive and emotionally moving live orchestra. Meanwhile, the Sonic concert was just sheer hype. I thoroughly 
              enjoyed my time at both and would not trade these experiences for anything.  
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">But once the Sonic concert was finished, Bell and I had to head home for the last time feeling the bellies of our souls full with satisfaction.
              It was naturally sad that something so fantastic was over, but I cannot repeat it enough, it was a life changing experience, and besides, getting to go home got to capture a beautiful
              scene of Gare de Lyon late at night.

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Thank you for reading! As it's been over a year since I first experienced these concerts, my recollection of events might have been a
              bit hazy but I've tried to recall everything I could and back it up with photos I have from the event.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">I realize, of course, that this is only a snippit of my actual experience in Paris. But, I want to share all that I can with you guys.
              It's not truly possible to share every small little detail, but I hope what I have shared paints an adequite picture of the time I had.
