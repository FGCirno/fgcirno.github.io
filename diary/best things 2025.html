              <h2 style="color: orange"><u>My Favorite 2025 Things!</u></h2>
              <p>
                Today, I wanted to share with you some of my favorite 2025
                releases. There was so much I loved that came out this year, and
                I simply want to share lots of it with you!
              </p>

              <h3 style="color: orange"><u>Hollow Knight: Silksong</u></h3>
              <p>
                Let's get the obvious one out of the way right now. Silksong was
                every bit as amazing as anyone who was hyped for it expected.
                I'm a somewhat new fan to Hollow Knight. I bought the first game
                when it first launched on Steam, but put off playing it until
                Silksong's release date got announced. In those two weeks
                between Silksong getting it's release date announced and coming
                out, I played through the entire first game in 40hrs.
              </p>

              <p>
                The original game had some pretty clear flaws to me. Many
                lamented its map while I found its gameplay loop pretty
                simplistic. Silksong in many ways improves on what Hollow Knight
                did, and more faithfully creates Team Cherry's vision with the
                first game. It is the idea of what the first game wanted to be
                turned into an actual game.
              </p>

              <figure style="text-align: center; color: lightgray">
                <img
                  src="../img/skong.jpg"
                  style="max-width: 550px; max-height: 350px"
                />
                <figcaption style="padding: 0.5%">
                  <span
                    >Bone Bottom's entrance, the lowest point of Pharloom</span
                  >
                </figcaption>
              </figure>

              <p>
                Of course all aspects of Silksong I found wonderfully
                melancholic and enjoyable, but what surprised me the most about
                the game was the pacing. It being split into two major acts, Act
                1: Pharloom and Act 2: Citadel, it basically feels like Hollow
                Knight got two different sequel games. While there is a
                narrative throughline with Hornet immediately wanting to rise to
                the top of the Citadel from Pharloom's Bone Bottom, there's a
                clear shift between the first and second halves.
              </p>

              <p>
                Basically, the Pharloom section of the game feels much the same
                as the original game. You're exploring new areas which are very
                endemic, lots of caves and fields that make up the world, where
                as the second act completely turns that on it's head. Being
                entirely inside the Citadel, it's much more like you're stuck in
                something like Dracula's Castle. In that sense, it really feels
                like the true game starts when you're half way through the game,
                at the Citadel's gates.
              </p>

              <p>
                Yet the whole game throughout is great. There's a lot of
                narrative throughlines, with the earlier parts of the game
                setting up the religious capitalistic civilization these bugs in
                Pharloom are victim to and that theme of corrupting capital
                remains throughout the entire game. Similarly, this game has a
                big focus on it's soundtrack, and songs that are important to
                the heart of the Citadel play as simply echos at the far bottom
                below it, faintly heard, missed if you're not aware.
              </p>

              </figure>

              <p>
                There's so much to love about Silksong, no matter what you're
                there for. Even if you don't care about story, music or world
                building like I've talked about the game still has fantastic
                punishing but fair gameplay that's way, way faster than the
                first game. There's a lot to love with Silksong, and it's easily
                a near perfect game in my eyes.
              </p>

              <h3 style="color: orange"><u>City: The Animation</u></h3>
              <p>
                City is the sequel series to Kyoto Animation's 2011 comedy
                classic Nichijou and having that information might paint some
                assumptions in your mind. You'll do best to dismiss them,
                because City is ultimately it's own thing. It does what it's
                name implies, and tries to tell a heartful slice of life story
                where the city itself is the protagonist. You'll find an
                intermingling cast of wholly interesting characters who have
                hardly anything to do with each other.
              </p>

              <p>
                There's the Makabe family and their "Western Food Restraunt"
                (which exclusively serves Japanese food every time we see them),
                and then there's Nagumo, the closest thing we have to a main
                character in this series, who happens to work part time for
                them. Nagumo is connected to her roommates Niikura and Wako
                Izumi. Wako has a sister named Riko who is in middle school, and
                through her we get to meet an entire class worth of characters.
                This goes on and on, every character in City is connected in
                some incredibly minor way and it leads to really fun little
                intertwined moments that really work. It's easily the best "City
                is the Protagonist" series I've seen, and succeeds at that
                gimmick better than anything I've ever seen before.
              </p>

              <figure style="text-align: center; color: lightgray">
                <img
                  src="../img/nagumo.gif"
                  style="max-width: 550px; max-height: 350px"
                />

                </figcaption>
              </figure>

              <p>
                City definitely wears its heart on its sleeve, yet it's not just
                wholesome. While it's genuine moments, characters and locale are
                why I adore it, it is also probably the single most impressive
                piece of animation to come out this year. There are plenty of
                moment of sakuga in every single episode, used often to
                emphasize punchlines like in Nichijou but often times there's
                moments that are just highly animated for no good reason. It's
                fantastic and an absolutely delight to the eyes.
              </p>

              <p>
                Every time there's a big pop off in the animation, it's followed
                by some sort of emotional resonance. Some character feeling pure
                rage, bliss, desparation, embarassment. Basically, the sakuga is
                there in support of the heart of the show more than punchlines,
                which really makes you relate to the characters even more.
              </p>

              <figure style="text-align: center; color: lightgray">
                <img
                  src="../img/niikura.gif"

                <figcaption style="padding: 0.5%">

                </figcaption>
              </figure>

              <p>
                Perhaps the peak of City's amazing animation would have to be
                it's incredibly impressive Episode 5. In this episode, Nagumo
                has been kidnapped by a perhaps too kind butler who wishes to
                reward her with a feast and an award for a good deed that she
                doesn't even remember doing. While she tries to escape from the
                "Hospitality Tower" by conquering the 12 floors below the one
                shes on, we slowly pull the camera back and start focusing on
                other characters. First, we see Niikura looking for her pendant
                (which she lost in the previous episode) while animations of
                Nagumo and her party try to escampe the tower plays on the
                right, then we get to see the Go Home Club added to the mix, and
                the middle schools soccer team and so on.
              </p>

              <p>Eventually, we're left with a screen that looks like this:</p>

              <figure style="text-align: center; color: lightgray">
                <img
                  src="../img/city105.gif"
                  style="max-width: 550px; max-height: 350px"
                />
                <figcaption style="padding: 0.5%">
                  <span>City Episode 5 in all its glory</span>
                </figcaption>
              </figure>

              <p>
                You're not meant to focus on everything at once, more so it
                gives you so much more perspective the next time you watch the
                episode. I've seen it five times through showing friends the
                series and every single time I learn something new. Even in just
                this gif there's so much detail that, since all the secondary
                stories are silent, you won't have full answers to til later.
                We're introduced to characters in this segment just through them
                having a little story in their own box in this episode that
                wouldn't get named let alone properly introduced until the next
                episode, or episode 7, episode 8.
              </p>

              <p>
                All of this has a purpose as well. We learn that these aren't
                separate stories. All these people are going to the same place.
                This is truly a *City* animation. A bustling, living and
                breathing society where everyone is moving within and doing
                their own thing. It's kind of the thesis statement for why I
                find the show so good in general, compounded into a single
                incredibly well animated episode. It's fantastic, and so is the
                rest of the series.
