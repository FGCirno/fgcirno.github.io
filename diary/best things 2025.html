              <p>
                Today, I wanted to share with you some of my favorite 2025
                releases. There was so much I loved that came out this year, and
                I simply want to share lots of it with you!
              </p>

              <h3 style="color: orange"><u>Hollow Knight: Silksong</u></h3>
              <p>
                Let's get the obvious one out of the way right now. Silksong was
                every bit as amazing as anyone who was hyped for it expected.
                I'm a somewhat new fan to Hollow Knight. I bought the first game
                when it first launched on Steam, but put off playing it until
                Silksong's release date got announced. In those two weeks
                between Silksong getting it's release date announced and coming
                out, I played through the entire first game in 40hrs.
              </p>

              <p>
                The original game had some pretty clear flaws to me. Many
                lamented its map while I found its gameplay loop pretty
                simplistic. Silksong in many ways improves on what Hollow Knight
                did, and more faithfully creates Team Cherry's vision with the
                first game. It is the idea of what the first game wanted to be
                turned into an actual game.
              </p>

              <figure style="text-align: center; color: lightgray">
                <img
                  src="../img/2025/skong.jpg"
                  style="max-width: 550px; max-height: 350px"
                />
                <figcaption style="padding: 0.5%">
                  <span
                    >Bone Bottom's entrance, the lowest point of Pharloom</span
                  >
                </figcaption>
              </figure>

              <p>
                Of course all aspects of Silksong I found wonderfully
                melancholic and enjoyable, but what surprised me the most about
                the game was the pacing. It being split into two major acts, Act
                1: Pharloom and Act 2: Citadel, it basically feels like Hollow
                Knight got two different sequel games. While there is a
                narrative throughline with Hornet immediately wanting to rise to
                the top of the Citadel from Pharloom's Bone Bottom, there's a
                clear shift between the first and second halves.
              </p>

              <p>
                Basically, the Pharloom section of the game feels much the same
                as the original game. You're exploring new areas which are very
                endemic, lots of caves and fields that make up the world, where
                as the second act completely turns that on it's head. Being
                entirely inside the Citadel, it's much more like you're stuck in
                something like Dracula's Castle. In that sense, it really feels
                like the true game starts when you're half way through the game,
                at the Citadel's gates.
              </p>

              <p>
                Yet the whole game throughout is great. There's a lot of
                narrative throughlines, with the earlier parts of the game
                setting up the religious capitalistic civilization these bugs in
                Pharloom are victim to and that theme of corrupting capital
                remains throughout the entire game. Similarly, this game has a
                big focus on it's soundtrack, and songs that are important to
                the heart of the Citadel play as simply echos at the far bottom
                below it, faintly heard, missed if you're not aware.

              <p>
                There's so much to love about Silksong, no matter what you're
                there for. Even if you don't care about story, music or world
                building like I've talked about the game still has fantastic
                punishing but fair gameplay that's way, way faster than the
                first game. There's a lot to love with Silksong, and it's easily
                a near perfect game in my eyes.

              </p>



              <h3 style="color: orange"><u>City: The Animation</u></h3>
              <p>
                City is the sequel series to Kyoto Animation's 2011 comedy
                classic Nichijou and having that information might paint some
                assumptions in your mind. You'll do best to dismiss them,
                because City is ultimately it's own thing. It does what it's
                name implies, and tries to tell a heartful slice of life story
                where the city itself is the protagonist. You'll find an
                intermingling cast of wholly interesting characters who have
                hardly anything to do with each other.
              </p>

              <p>
                There's the Makabe family and their "Western Food Restraunt"
                (which exclusively serves Japanese food every time we see them),
                and then there's Nagumo, the closest thing we have to a main
                character in this series, who happens to work part time for
                them. Nagumo is connected to her roommates Niikura and Wako
                Izumi. Wako has a sister named Riko who is in middle school, and
                through her we get to meet an entire class worth of characters.
                This goes on and on, every character in City is connected in
                some incredibly minor way and it leads to really fun little
                intertwined moments that really work. It's easily the best "City
                is the Protagonist" series I've seen, and succeeds at that
                gimmick better than anything I've ever seen before.
              </p>

              <figure style="text-align: center; color: lightgray">
                <img

              </figure>

              <p>
                City definitely wears its heart on its sleeve, yet it's not just
                wholesome. While it's genuine moments, characters and locale are
                why I adore it, it is also probably the single most impressive
                piece of animation to come out this year. There are plenty of
                moment of sakuga in every single episode, used often to
                emphasize punchlines like in Nichijou but often times there's
                moments that are just highly animated for no good reason. It's
                fantastic and an absolutely delight to the eyes.
              </p>

              <p>
                Every time there's a big pop off in the animation, it's followed
                by some sort of emotional resonance. Some character feeling pure
                rage, bliss, desparation, embarassment. Basically, the sakuga is
                there in support of the heart of the show more than punchlines,
                which really makes you relate to the characters even more.
              </p>

              <figure style="text-align: center; color: lightgray">
                <img

                </figcaption>
              </figure>

              <p>
                Perhaps the peak of City's amazing animation would have to be
                it's incredibly impressive Episode 5. In this episode, Nagumo
                has been kidnapped by a perhaps too kind butler who wishes to
                reward her with a feast and an award for a good deed that she
                doesn't even remember doing. While she tries to escape from the
                "Hospitality Tower" by conquering the 12 floors below the one
                shes on, we slowly pull the camera back and start focusing on
                other characters. First, we see Niikura looking for her pendant
                (which she lost in the previous episode) while animations of
                Nagumo and her party try to escampe the tower plays on the
                right, then we get to see the Go Home Club added to the mix, and
                the middle schools soccer team and so on.
              </p>

              <p>Eventually, we're left with a screen that looks like this:</p>

              <figure style="text-align: center; color: lightgray">
                <img
                  src="../img/2025/city105.gif"
                  style="max-width: 550px; max-height: 350px"

                <figcaption style="padding: 0.5%">
                  <span>City Episode 5 in all its glory</span>
                </figcaption>
              </figure>

              <p>
                You're not meant to focus on everything at once, more so it
                gives you so much more perspective the next time you watch the
                episode. I've seen it five times through showing friends the
                series and every single time I learn something new. Even in just
                this gif there's so much detail that, since all the secondary
                stories are silent, you won't have full answers to til later.
                We're introduced to characters in this segment just through them
                having a little story in their own box in this episode that
                wouldn't get named let alone properly introduced until the next
                episode, or episode 7, episode 8.
              </p>

              <p>
                All of this has a purpose as well. We learn that these aren't
                separate stories. All these people are going to the same place.
                This is truly a *City* animation. A bustling, living and
                breathing society where everyone is moving within and doing
                their own thing. It's kind of the thesis statement for why I
                find the show so good in general, compounded into a single
                incredibly well animated episode. It's fantastic, and so is the
                rest of the series.
              </p>

              <h3 style="color: orange"><u>Sunshine Backwards</u></h3>
              <p>Ooh, this one is REALLY painful.</p>

              <figure style="text-align: center; color: lightgray">
                <img
                  src="../img/2025/sunshine.png"
                  style="max-width: 550px; max-height: 350px"
                />
                <figcaption style="padding: 0.5%">
                  <span>Sunshine Backwards</span>
                </figcaption>
              </figure>

              <p>
                In so many ways, Sunshine Backwards just feels like my history
                being projected onto my monitor. It's a story about a fuck up 20
                something trans girl who comes home from her dead end job and
                just puts on old Adult Swim recordings from the early 2000s on
                to just sit there, and not feel anything. Getting as crossfaded
                as possible. Her past is incredibly messy, and we learn that
                she's been severely wronged by many people in her life. She
                feels like she was groomed, and when her groomer came out as
                trans after her she doesn't think they're valid. Just... it's so
                fucking close to what I've lived through. It's like the
                characters of Sonia and Rosy are conjoined fragments of everyone
                I ever knew growing up and myself, and the gruesome and horrific
                way the game depicts Sonia's trauma is potent as someone who can
                relate.
              </p>

              <p>
                Another thing Sonia is nostalgic for is the time when she was
                obsessed with Sonic the Hedgehog creepypasta. This game is
                called Sunshine Backwards afterall, so of course we're gonna
                talk about playing Can You Feel The Sunshine on reverse while in
                your bathroom to try and summon the Tails Doll to come and kill
                you. Maybe about the only difference between my experience and
                Sonia's is that when I did that with my childhood friend I
                didn't wet myself or get sent home. But, I have a very, very
                strong memory of me and my friend being so obnoxious it work up
                her dad, and he was NOT happy.
              </p>

              <p>
                There's this other memory I have that to this day I have no idea
                what to make of. I was alone at night, probably 6 or 7 years
                old. I see the pulsing of a red light outside my window, focused
                around a diamond shape like the Tails Doll's gemstone. It stays
                still for a while, before getting closer and closer rapidly. I'm
                terrified, I stop looking out of the window and just lay as
                still as I can in my bed... ... ... and then, out of nowhere,
                something falls on top of me. Something soft, but with immense
                weight. I throw it as hard as I can and run to my Great
                Grandmother who is four rooms away on the other side of the
                house and just cry and cry while hugging her. I seriously have
                no idea what could've fallen on me, and that memory hasn't left
                me since.
              </p>

              <p>
                My experiences with the Tails Doll were so important to me, and
                I was so mistified by the curse and how cool and edgy I thought
                the internets perception of the character was, that I made a lot
                of my early usernames TailsDoll98. I was completely enamored
                with the little guy and even now I hold some fondness for that
                overly edgy period of my life. That alone would make me on board
                with Sunshine Backwards, and yet it also ended up being deeply
                relatable for reasons separate from that little Sonic character.

                I don't know if myself and the VN's creator Clover sharing an
                interest in the Tails Doll at formative points in our lives just
                made us have similar life experiences, but I'm incredibly happy
                to know someone shared so much of the experience that make me
                who I am today. I'm happy, but it also makes me feel complex. If
                part of this VN are as real as Clover implies, then I'm sorry
                for all she had to go through. Like I said, I personally know so
                much of the hardship that goes on in this visual novel. Meeting
                an internet stranger who gets very, very close to you who
                happens to be 10 years older than you when you're a teenager,
                the feeling years later that meeting *them* was the single worst
                thing to happen to you and is a traceable point where your life
                derailed for good, complete and utter burnout with the modernity
                of life and having to fucking work at a place where nobody gives
                a shit about you, rambling on and on so passionately while
                nobody has ANY sympathy for whats happened to you. I get it, and
                I also get that so much of what happens in this VN is pure
                venting. Being able to take all that and be like "well, what
                *if* I snapped. Lets write a scenario about that. What if, in my
                dying dream I consumed the one who completely ruined my life."
                It's pure catharsis.

              <h3 style="color: orange"><u>Elden Ring Nightreign</u></h3>
              <p>
                Elden Ring Nightreign in my opinion is complete lightning in a
                bottle. They took all of Elden Ring's bosses, themes, the
                worldbuilding concepts and just condensed it into a completely
                different experience. Nightreign in its purest essence embodies
                Elden Ring: Arcade Mode. It is short, spontaneous gameplay
                segmented into 40 minute play sessions instead of being a full
                length RPG like the base game, and it couldn't be more
                beautiful.
              </p>

              <p>
                With mechanics inspired by battle royale games like Fortnite
                with it's encroaching circle and random loot, Nightreign always
                keeps you moving and on your toes. The game wants to make sure
                you hardly have any time to think about what you're doing as you
                go from boss to boss, constantly moving and fighting to prepare
                for the encroaching night. It is pure gameplay bliss, and
                probably one of the best uses of reusing assets to make an
                ENTIRELY different experience out there. Everyone knows Elden
                Ring's bosses. So many of these bosses were very famous for
                their difficulty, movesets, their gimmicks. But for me, who only
                played through the whole thing one time, Nightreign has been
                perfect to really ingrain these characters, these bosses and
                their movesets into my thick skull. I never knew how truly
                special everything to do with these bosses were til I played an
                upward of a hundred runs in Nightreign. Now I truly know these
                bosses

                With the Deep of Night gamemode added this last September and
                promises of future DLC on the way, it seems like Nightreign will
                be supported for a long time still. With Deep of Night, there's
                a really good progression where each difficulty mode feels
                *just* hard enough for whatever skill level you're at, normal <
                everdark < deep of night. I think what I'm getting at is I feel
                there's so much intentionality with Nightreign's game design.
              </p>

              <p>
                I think Nightreign is a complete masterclass of gameplay, but my
                boyfriend loves it even more than I do. He has nearly three
                times my playtime in the game, and we've played a lot together.
                I asked what he loved the most about Nightreign and this is what
                he had to say:

              <h3 style="color: orange"><u>The 8bitdo Pro 3 Controller</u></h3>
              <p>
                Lets finish with a few simple ones. Controller Manufacturer
                8bitdo put out a new model of their Pro series controller the
                Pro 3 this year, and it has quickly risen to be one of my
                favorite controllers of all time. It's very tacticle, there's a
                lot of feedback when you press buttons (notably the d-pad is
                incredibly clicky, as are R2 and L2 when you lock them and the
                new R4 and L4 buttons on the shoulders using actual mouse parts
                for maximum auditory and physical response).
              </p>

              <p>
                The feel of the controller much like the Pro 2 is very grainy
                when unboxed, but it's almost guaratneed that this grain goes
                away after months of use (mine certainly has). It's unfortunate
                because I really like how the rough feel of the controller is
                before that gets worn down. The general design of the controller
                is very similar to either the Dualshock 4 or more directly the
                Wii Classic Controller Pro (itself being inspired by the SNES
                controller). 8bitdo often makes controllers that imitate other
                controllers, like their SN30 which is VERY clearly an SNES
                controller. The Pro 3, while evocative of other designs (even
                having the same face buttons as an SNES controller, you can swap
                them out for those if you really wanted to) it simply feels so
                much better than any other controller I've used aside from maybe
                the Dualsense.
              </p>

              <p>
                Great controller, almost no notes. My few problems come with the
                controllers gimmicks. It has easily interchangable face buttons
                and because of that, they're built more brittle than they would
                be otherwise. My biggest problem comes with the lack of six-axis
                gyro while using the controllers dongle. The recent Windows 11
                update at the start of the year completely broke my bluetooth
                adapter, so I'm completely out of luck in terms of being able to
                use gyro at all with this controller on PC. I was hoping they'd
                fix that over the Pro 2, but they let me down.

                That's right! This website launched this year in July, about
                half a year ago. I was never any good at programming, but I took
                one look at this domain, and another look at the YouTube channel
                name I've been sitting on for years and knew I had to snatch it.
                I'm so happy I did because this website has been a huge passion
                project for me, and it's pushed me to really learn how to make a
                functioning website and just make stuff that's fun
              </p>

              <p>
                I get to write as much as I want here and nobody can stop me!
                That being said, I've felt sort of torn at points. Unable to put
                my honesty out there in the world. That's a flaw I'll need to
                confront going forwards with this website, especially if I get a
                following and my video essays take off. Speaking of...
              </p>

              <h3 style="color: orange"><u>My YouTube Career</u></h3>
              <p>
                2025 was the year I finally started working on video making for
                a hobby. Though, I'm hoping I can make it something more than
                that. The video making process is a ton of fun, especially
                scripting
              </p>

              <h3 style="color: orange"><u>much more</u></h3>
              <p>
                2025 was a great year for me in terms of finishing stuff that
                has been on my radar for a long time. A lot of what I played
                this year
                <a
                  href="https://backloggd.com/u/MinervaFFXIV/list/minervas-played-in-2025-list/"
                >
                  can be seen in my backloggd media thread for the year.
                </a>
                For example, I started and finished both of CD Projekt Red's
                major "recent" releases, the Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 (both
                of which have been in my sights since they came out.) For the
                longest time, I knew I'd really enjoy Witcher 3 in spite of all
                of it's very obvious problems and that held true. The way its
                dialogue is handled alongside its cutscene framing, world
                building and dark themes surrounding traditional fantasy cliche
                is all wonderful to me, and entirely up my alley. Cyberpunk was
                a very similar case for me, as a big fan of immersive sims like
                its trying to be in adition to dark themes and dialogue focus
                like I mentioned with the Witcher, Cyberpunk shares those
                traits.

                Another game on my backlog which I finally played through and
                meant a lot to me was Phantom Brave. It was a game I grew up
                with with Phantom Brave: We Meet Again on the Wii back in the
                day, and I was instantly charmed by everything about it, its
                art, music, how awesome Marona was as a protagonist. I was a fan
                of Disgaea already so I was primed for Nippon Ichi's style and
                Phantom Brave absolutely didn't let down in that regard.

                This year was a lot of clean up for me, and it helped me feel
                very, very productive in myself. I started a website, I started
                to become a video essayist like I've always wanted, I cleared
                off so many things that have been on my backlog for years, and I
                played so many great games that were brand new to this year.
                This was the year where I really focused on myself, and that
                even includes stuff like voice training, sticking to my
                medication (hell maybe that's why I was so productive, thanks to
                the emotional stat buff from HRT). While much in life this year
                was awful, notably the climate surrounding everything with
                America, but in my personal life things have been alright.
              </p>

              <p>I have high hopes for myself in 2026.</p>
