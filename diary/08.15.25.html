                    I finally pushed out a pretty significant visual overhaul to
                this place. I'm pretty pleased with the way it looks and have to
                thank Bell a bunch for helping significantly with his decades of
                coding experience he has above me.
                </p>
                <p>
                I've also
                been working on a bit of a secondary project of mine. I
                mentioned before that I'm an aspiring YouTuber. Well, I've
                finished recording for my first video I'm planning on making.
                It's going to be on the 2004 Nippon Ichi Software game Phantom
                Brave (specifically using footage from the Steam rerelease by
                the lovely people behind DSFix). I have a lot to say about it
                and the script for that video is presently 8,991 words long and
                counting. I'm about half way done with it. I'm hoping it's not
                too big of an undertaking, but it's a bit of a passion project
                of mine and I hope it gets more eyes on Phantom Brave.
                </p>
                <p>
                Other videos I have planned are an essay about how interesting
                debut games are compared to series that go on for a long time
                (see: Sonic, Kingdom Hearts, Devil May Cry), a video comparing
                in depth Omori and Deltarune (not original but a video like that
                hasn't been made since Chapter 2 was the newest part of
                Deltarune), and a video on Yoshiro Kimura's many video games.
