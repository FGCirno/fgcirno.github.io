            <h2 style="color: orange;  text-align: center; font-family: Renogare;"><u><b>My Creative Journey hits the Next Level!</b></u></h2>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">The video editing project I mentioned before has been going well. I took a bit of a change of direction and instead of biting off a Phantom Brave video immediately. I decided to make a video on the game design of Moon: Remix RPG Adventure, a PS1 game from 1997 by a now defunct company called Love-de-Lic. If you somehow haven’t heard about it, it’s a game written and designed by one Yoshiro Kimura who went on to develop Chulip and the recently released Stray Children.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">There are plenty of videos on the game already so I decided to narrow my focus a bit. I figured instead of making a video on the whole game, start to finish, I’d focus instead on specific elements of the game. Moon has a lot of really unique gameplay systems. It’s a game where you go around, talk to people, wait for something to happen and it leads to you sort of treating the people in the game world as puzzles to be solved.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">I focus on that aspect of gameplay in my video as well as the game’s central antagonist and how he’s presented. The game is a critique on JRPGs and specifically JRPG tropes. The main villain of the game is the traditional Hero of those games. A silent, armor clad warrior whose going around killing everything in sight for EXP. I’m happy about the way I’ve managed to talk about the game, and I hope you are too by the time my video comes out.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Moon is a really unique game and, like Phantom Brave, I’m very interested in talking about it to spread awareness of its existence. There’s so much to it that I left out of the video for brevity that I’d otherwise happily share. The game uses garbled audio samples for character speech the same way later games like Banjo Kazooie or even Undertale do. A lot of the samples are from stock libraries, American, French or Germanic commercials, some clips of Japanese guys yelling. There are even some robots in the game that speak using the Serial Experiments Lain / No More Heroes Text to Speech. It’s incredibly charming, and I wish I could just gush about it more but there’s no room for it in my video.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Likewise, I think the main plot of the game has a lot to say about connecting with others, about the value of games and equally the value of going outside. I’d love to talk about that in detail in my video, but I think my focus needs to be narrow. This thing is hard enough to edit together as is. But needless to say, the game has a very Evangelion Rebuild sort of outlook on things. Put down the game, open the door to your room and go socialize! But instead of being pessimistic it chooses to prop games up instead. It’s a lovely message, and I feel it works well for a game that critiques JRPGs.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">So far, I’m incredibly happy with my work. My chapter transitions especially are fantastic. The opening to the video is set to “Moonlight” from the game’s OST (in reality it’s a version of Clair de Lune) with an edit that keeps the characters animation synced so it looks like the background is moving around them in stillness. It’s cliché, but I’m proud of myself since this is the first time I’ve tried something so ambitious.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">In a similar vein, I introduce the Hero in the second chapter (about 13 minutes into the video) with a cut to a Japanese commercial for the game depicting the Hero in live action, full Erdrick cosplay. It’s an incredibly tacky commercial, but I think it really, really understands the game. Of course it does, since it’s a commercial by a Japanese market for that same market. It’s tacky, but cool just like the villainous Hero. It’s the perfect intro to that section of the video (and absolutely inspired by the work of KingK and The RPG Monger on YouTube).</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Moon's gameplay asks you to be both patient in understanding characters schedules and waiting on them, as well as being a pacifist in showing the Hero as the big bad guy to not be like. I don't think it's perfect and I talk about that a bit in my video, but I think more games like it deserve to exist. Chulip is passingly similar, but it's kind of the last of its kind. I wish there were more games by Yoshiro Kimura that were just about walking around in a world and relating to all the characters.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Of course, Moon isn't the only thing I want to talk about on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@StarfallGallery">my YouTube</a>. I mentioned Phantom Brave before and I still intend to give that game the respect it deserves. I have a plethora of videos regarding Like a Dragon in my back pocket (various studies, both of specific characters in Infinite Wealth like Yamai or Eiji, or looks at these games open world designs). I would like to make a video on my favorite games like Sonic Adventure 2, and I’ve even began recording for that.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">For my Moon video I’m mostly satisfied with what I’ve done so far. The one issue I’m trying to think of how to approach is my voice. I’ve been somewhat lax with my voice training recently thanks to circumstance in my life. I haven’t been getting enough privacy, so it’s hard to really do a voice I want to do. A lot of my voice-over I’ve done for the video at present is rough, and needs redoing. The only problem is if I’m able to sound how I want to when presenting to an audience. I’m sure I’ll figure something out, but I want to be satisfied with myself, not just tolerate being average. </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">I’m happy that I’m finally moving forwards on this step in my life. This website and my YouTube career have been huge creative outlets, and when I actually work on them I feel super fulfilled. I feel kind of talent-less most of the time so I feel like I’m actually learning something, and doing work I love. I simply wish I could channel some of this into my voice-training, body training or my French studies. I need to do all of this to live my ideal life, but it’s so difficult for me to start anything.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">But with YouTube I’m hopeful that I can start a proper career. I’m in a complicated situation where I can’t get traditional work, yet the economy gets rougher and rougher. I hope my videos get some amount of traction so I can make some sort of a living and support my partner through these tough times. </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">I'm hard at work on this video, and I'm hoping to put it out by the end of the year. If possible, before November is over.</p>

            <figure class="figure" style="padding-left: 285px;">

              <figcaption style="caption-side: bottom;">This game rocks. Go check it out!</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">More than anything I hope to keep perusing creativity. I love creating, and I love working on long term projects like this website and my videos. I want to be like the people I respect and idolize instead of just some sort of useless loser. Instead, I’ll be a loser who is marginally less useless because I’m living a life I can respect. I’d love to take Moon’s advice and open the door to the outside world more often, but in the meantime I’ll keep being me.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px; text-align: center;">Thank you very much for reading. Please look forwards to my future works.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;">💜</p>
