                The news hit me without warning this last Tuesday. My dad was dead. <br class="noselect"><br class="noselect">
                He died far too young, and though we were estranged, the news of his passing has filled me with a deep depression. A sort of empty void in my core.
                In the days after learning the news, I'd catch myself just staring off into the distance, dissociating. He wasn't a good person, certainly someone I rarely if ever felt safe around, and yet his death still hits me hard.
                I'm sad that there won't ever be a way to remedy things, that I couldn't lift his burden and help him out of the depressed slump he was in for much of his final years, sad he never got to know me better.
                I don't blame myself for my lack of contact, but our last meeting was full of anguish and hatred, <br class="noselect">I suppose I wish I could have better final memories of him.
                <br class="noselect"><br class="noselect">
                Despite his death, life still goes on. Learning of his death wouldn't stop the plans I already had for that evening. 
                Whenever a death like this happens, it always bothers me how quickly society expects you to get past it and put on a mask, not let your uncomfortable feelings of grief out.
                I've experienced this sort of social phenomena several times in my life, with my grandmother's far too early death, the death of pets, and I'm never truly okay with it. We all need time to deal with our grief, and life simply never gives us that time.
                <br class="noselect"><br class="noselect">
                Rest in peace, Dad.
