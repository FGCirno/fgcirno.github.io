                <h3 style="color: orange;"><u>Remembering My Dad</u></h3>
              
                  <p>
                    My father passed away two weeks ago. Our relationship was damaged for my entire life. He wasn't around when I was a child because he was in jail over drug posession and theft, and when he did come back into my life he displayed a lot of the habits that no doubt got him in jail in the first place. I couldn't stand living with him when I was in middle school, coming back to a home where I was made to sleep under a dining table behind a curtain that I could call my "room", with the heavy stench of pot in the air and strange people I didn't know.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Things ended between us in an expectedly hostile way. When my grandma passed away in 2019 and while I'd been living with her, I let him know where she was living which lead to him breaking into where I was living on two different occasions, ending in me handing him a restraining order and him baselessly accusing me of my grandma's death. That was the last time I ever talked to him. Since then I've come out as trans, I'm living a completely different life in a different country from him and while I expected I could hear about his death, I had no idea how I would.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A sherrif in the county he died in managed to find me as his next of kin, and tracked down my email and old roommates. He didn't tell me the news in his first email, so when I called him back it was as simple as "I'm sorry, I've got some unfortunate news". I was shocked. Completely stunned by what I was hearing. My dad, who I thought would somehow be a thorn in my side forever and who I thought would end up outliving me was dead. The reality of these words still doesn't feel real and I don't know if it ever will truly set in for me.

                <h3 style="color: orange;"><u>Life Moves Fowards</u></h3>
                  <p>
                    Within the same hour I got the news of my dad's death, I already had social obligations planned. At this point I was doing weekly raids in Final Fantasy XIV and I had unfortunately learned about his passing the same day a raid was scheduled. I didn't cancel or really express anything. I simply stayed quiet, and all of my raid group members simply accepted it. Nobody questioned why I was being more quiet than usual, or why I was performing worse than usual. It was simply another night, and nothing was off. I feel I could've opened up, but I don't see the point.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the days following the news, I'd find myself simply staring off into the distance and dissociating. I never had a good relationship with him, but he's still my father. Even if our relationship was bad, it still meant something to me. Knowing that there's no way we can possibly make things okay, even if I never intended too, stings. My boyfriend would catch me in one of these depressed spirals and simply question what the problem was. Of course, he should've known what the problem was without even asking, because he was well aware of my dad's death at that point.
                  </p>

                    I find that when people die, the world is often much to quick to move on. If someone you love and cared for passes away, you will not have enough time to mourn. You will be expected to go into work the next day, or maybe you'll get a day or two off and that's it. You have to carry the baggage of recognizing death up this hill of life with you, and there's no way around it. People won't accept you if you slow down. I wish we lived in a kinder society, one that lets people get over these substantial problems, but we don't. I'm starting to get better, but it'll still take time for me to fully digest these feelings.

                  <h3 style="color: orange;"><u>Memories of You</u></h3>
                  <p>
                    My Dad was a musician. In his life, I don't think I never really respected that, but I really admire him living for such a creative endeavour. Without him in my life, I don't think I'd be as creative as I am, nor would I be as into media. Life was often hard with him, but I do still have some great memories. I remember us going to plenty of lakes to hang out. I remember him trying to clean up his act to live with my grandma and myself when I was just out of highschool. I remember going to summer festivals with him, and him helping me with my first jobs. If I didn't have him there to act as a warning not to dive head first into hardcore drugs, I probably would've become an addict like most of my family before me.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's easy to ignore the good when your family member is someone toxically flawed, and equally it's easy to ignore all the bad after they die. I will simply accept him for what he was: a man who could've been wonderful, who simply got beaten down by life until he became who he did. He very much so felt betrayed by the system and his family, very much like I do. He just took things way too far. In the end, I think his depression consumed him. He felt betrayed his whole life, and then when his mother passed away, he lost any motivation to better himself. The two people he felt he could always rely on in his life, his mother and his daughter, dead if not as good as dead to him. It must've been so hard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While I wish we could've ended things on better terms, I don't regret my choices. He was very much so living a destructive life with people who enabled him til his last days. I don't think anything I could've done would pull him out of that. It's hard not to blame myself, but things simply wouldn't have changed with me there. After his passing, I saw that his widow put up a gofundme. She said that he doesn't have any living family, and that might as well be accurate. I have to wonder if my dad saw me as dead to him, or if his widow simply put that there for sympathy. I'll never know, as I don't think I could ever talk to her about it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I was asked by the sherrif who gave me the news of my dad's death to settle his estate, and I explained it wouldn't be possible since it would mean coming back to the USA. This lead to me giving him the name of much of my family who could handle things, which in turn lead to me having to out myself as trans to them. My cousin handled my Dad's cremation, and when I talked with her on the phone she seemed very emotional, and just happy that I'm okay all things considered. It was awkward, but could've been worse.
                  </p>
                  <h3 style="color: orange;"><u>Rest in Peace</u></h3>  
                  <p>
                    Much of my time with him was bad, yet his death weighs heavy on me. Even though we had an unhealthy relationship which affected me so deeply it defined a lot of who I am as a person, he was still my father. Even if I felt such deep resentment for him that I changed my last name from his, I accept that him as the one who gave me that deadname to begin with. I feel immense emptiness over losing him, and I don't know when I'll feel any better. But, I must move on. I will be my father's living legacy.
