                I've always had severe allergies. The air quality would be just
                bad enough, I'd have just the right amount of dust in the room
                and that'd leave me sneezing for 12hrs straight. Often times
                I'll have no idea what triggered my allergies, leaving me
                suffering with no idea for how to improve my situation. Just
                this last week, something triggered my allergies and it left me
                completely floored. I tried to sleep it off, but I only woke up
                to the sneezing being worse and completely drained of energy. It
                feels completely awful. I'm doing better now, but my nose is
                still stark red with exhaustion and crusty as can be.<br
                  class="noselect"
                /><br class="noselect" />Speaking of things in my life getting
                better, this past month I've picked vocal training back up.
                Previously when I first came out I tried voice feminization for
                a few months and just sort of lost the will to continue around
                the same time my HRT refill was denied. In spite of that, I'm
                finally back at it even though it's been years. I'm surprised
                that I've retained some of the pitch control I had from my past
                vocal training. It's not much, but in training my larynx again
                I've found myself able to hit higher pitches that I've since
                lost in my time since I last trained it. More than that, I've
                gotten some amount of resonance control and I'm quite happy with
                my results so far. I simply need to apply my fem voice anywhere
                I can in every day life, and I'll eventually have a voice I can
                be fully proud of.<br class="noselect" /><br class="noselect" />
                Might be silly to admit, but I'm looking to Bridget's dub voice
                from Guilty Gear Strive and Amy Rose from the early 2000s Sonic
                games as a sort of vocal inspiration. I want that sort of peppy
                yet not too too high pitched voice as my own. Some circumstance
                in my life relating to privacy has kept me from actively
                training much this week (in addition to being as sick as I was
                the past few days) but I really just need to make myself do it,
                even if I'm timid about being heard.<br class="noselect" /><br
                  class="noselect"
                />
                Things are going well for me. There's some turbulance like there
                always is in life, but I'm certain that things will only be
                better going forwards. I just need to keep doing things to
                benefit myself (like voice training or even working on this
                website) and everything will be just fine.
