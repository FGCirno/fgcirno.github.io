My father passed away two weeks ago. I had never once in my life
                had a good relationship with him, and in spite of that, the
                confirmation of his death left me with many complex feelings. I
                suppose for the last few years I've just been assuming he would
                outlive me, or at the very least never once considered his death
                in any sort of serious fashion. I'd speculate on when the day
                would come, wondering how I would find out (as it turns out, a
                sheriff from his county managed to track down a way to contact
                me even though I didn't want to be found) and it really was as
                simple as a phone call and "I'm sorry. I've got some bad news".
                Some people you just think will live forever, or, at the very
                least, you assume there's no way the information will reach you.
                That's ignorant, of course. Even though I haven't lived in
                America for a long time, my permanent record still exists there.
                A trace of myself, with a way to reach me, and with my dad's
                death yet another link to that has been opened. People don't
                give death the gravitas it demands. I will never see my dad
                again, never have another chance to make things right, hug him
                in spite of all our conflict, or bicker and yell empty threats
                at each other. All the moments I could share with him are lost
                to the wind, but life as a whole seems to want to hurry me
                along, to force me not to sit around absentmindedly pondering
                over ifs or what's. In the days following his death, I'd often
                end up losing myself just staring away for what would end up
                being 20 minutes when I came to. Should I not be able to take in
                the severity of the emotion causing that reaction? The world
                seems to think not. <br class="noselect" /><br
                  class="noselect"
                />The same time I got the news, I had an event I had to show up
                for: an obligation where nobody would even ask me "why are you
                being so silent today?". I just had to keep it to myself, keep
                my head down and work. Similarly, it felt as though my
                boyfriend, the bastion for my feelings and the one I trust more
                than anyone else, was the same. He didn't understand why I would
                feel so strongly since, like I said, my relationship with my
                father was messy. He'd ask how I was doing, and when I'd say
                "better today" he'd be confused. What was there to be better?
                Yesterday was just a day after all, like any other. It was as if
                I was living a completely different reality to anyone else
                around me. But, that's just sort of how it goes with death in
                this world. Twice now I've had to deal with this sort of death.
                My grandmother died unexpectedly in 2019 while I was living with
                her. Her last words to me were "Am I going to die?" as she was
                rushed to the ER, barely cognizant. She and my father never
                really knew me. When I was still young and my grandmother was
                still well, we talked. I dressed myself up nicely and well,
                still deeply in the closet about my gender, yet clearly my
                gender was screaming for acknowledgment, and well, my
                grandmother said she would love me no matter what. I believe
                her, if she lived past when I came out she would've been proud
                of me for being who I am. I can't really say how my dad would've
                taken the news. When I expressed stuff like that, he would
                always say "it's just a fad" and "I felt the same way as a kid,
                but I grew out of it". The last time I spoke to him was when I
                served him a restraining order after my grandmother's death. I
                think the death of both his parents and my rejection of him, I'm
                certain, spiraled him into a depression he never recovered from.
                I don't know if he knew I was trans, but him seeing me reject
                his name would have been yet another emotional dagger in his
                heart weak from a difficult life. I don't blame myself. His name
                wasn't one worth keeping. It was the name of a drug addict, of a
                narcissist. He was a deeply flawed man. He was my father. Rest
                in Peace Sean Allison. I may have rejected your name, yet I will
                live as your legacy.
