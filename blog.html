        <p class="entry">My father passed away two weeks ago. I had never once in my life had a good relationship with him, and in spite of that, the confirmation of his death left me with many complex feelings. I suppose for the last few years I've just been assuming he would outlive me, or at the very least never once considered his death in any sort of serious fashion. I'd speculate on when the day would come, wondering how I would find out (as it turns out, a sheriff from his county managed to track down a way to contact me even though I didn't want to be found) and it really was as simple as a phone call and "I'm sorry. I've got some bad news". Some people you just think will live forever, or, at the very least, you assume there's no way the information will reach you. That's ignorant, of course. Even though I haven't lived in America for a long time, my permanent record still exists there. A trace of myself, with a way to reach me, and with my dad's death yet another link to that has been opened. People don't give death the gravitas it demands. I will never see my dad again, never have another chance to make things right, hug him in spite of all our conflict, or bicker and yell empty threats at each other. All the moments I could share with him are lost to the wind, but life as a whole seems to want to hurry me along, to force me not to sit around absentmindedly pondering over ifs or what's. In the days following his death, I'd often end up losing myself just staring away for what would end up being 20 minutes when I came to. Should I not be able to take in the severity of the emotion causing that reaction? The world seems to think not. <br class="noselect"><br class="noselect">The same time I got the news, I had an event I had to show up for: an obligation where nobody would even ask me "why are you being so silent today?". I just had to keep it to myself, keep my head down and work. Similarly, it felt as though my boyfriend, the bastion for my feelings and the one I trust more than anyone else, was the same. He didn't understand why I would feel so strongly since, like I said, my relationship with my father was messy. He'd ask how I was doing, and when I'd say "better today" he'd be confused. What was there to be better? Yesterday was just a day after all, like any other. It was as if I was living a completely different reality to anyone else around me. But, that's just sort of how it goes with death in this world. <br class="noselect"><br class="noselect">Twice now I've had to deal with this sort of death. My grandmother died unexpectedly in 2019 while I was living with her. Her last words to me were "Am I going to die?" as she was rushed to the ER, barely cognizant. She and my father never really knew me. When I was still young and my grandmother was still well, we talked. I dressed myself up nicely and well, still deeply in the closet about my gender, yet clearly my gender was screaming for acknowledgment, and well, my grandmother said she would love me no matter what. I believe her, if she lived past when I came out she would've been proud of me for being who I am. I can't really say how my dad would've taken the news. When I expressed stuff like that, he would always say "it's just a fad" and "I felt the same way as a kid, but I grew out of it". The last time I spoke to him was when I served him a restraining order after my grandmother's death. I think the death of both his parents and my rejection of him, I'm certain, spiraled him into a depression he never recovered from. I don't know if he knew I was trans, but him seeing me reject his name would have been yet another emotional dagger in his heart weak from a difficult life. I don't blame myself. His name wasn't one worth keeping. It was the name of a drug addict, of a narcissist. He was a deeply flawed man. He was my father. Rest in Peace Sean Allison. I may have rejected your name, yet I will live as your legacy.</p>
      
        <p class="date">07/09/2025 - Getting Better</p>
        <p class="entry">For all my life, I've endured severe allergies. The air quality would be just bad enough, I'd have just the right amount of dust in the room or touch something I wasn't meant to and that'd leave me sneezing for 12hrs straight. Often times I'll have no idea what triggered my allergies, leaving me suffering with no idea for how to improve my situation. Just this last week, something triggered my allergies and it left me completely floored. I tried to sleep it off, but I only woke up to the sneezing being worse and completely drained of energy. It feels completely awful, and I wish I had some way to tell what exactly my problem is, why this is such a reoccuring thing in my life. I'm doing better now, but my nose is still stark red with exhaustion and crusty as can be.<br class="noselect"><br class="noselect">Speaking of things in my life getting better, this past month I've picked vocal training back up. Previously when I first came out I tried voice feminization for a few months and just sort of lost the will to continue around the same time my HRT refill was denied. In spite of that, I'm finally back at it even though it's been years. I'm surprised that I've retained some of the pitch control I had from my past vocal training. It's not much, but in training my larynx again I've found myself able to hit higher pitches that I've since lost in my time since I last trained it. More than that, I've gotten some amount of resonance control and I'm quite happy with my results so far. I simply need to apply my fem voice anywhere I can in every day life, and I'll eventually have a voice I can be fully proud of. Might be silly to admit, but I'm looking to Bridget's dub voice from Guilty Gear Strive and Amy Rose from the early 2000s Sonic games as a sort of vocal inspiration. I want that sort of peppy yet not too too high pitched voice as my own. Some circumstance in my life relating to privacy has kept me from actively training much this week (in addition to being as sick as I was the past few days) but I really just need to make myself do it, even if I'm timid about being heard.<br class="noselect"><br class="noselect"> Things are going well for me. There's some turbulance like there always is in life, but I'm certain that things will only be better going forwards. I just need to keep doing things to benefit myself (like voice training or even working on this website) and everything will be just fine.</p>
      
        <p class="date">06/16/2025 - A Warm Welcome</p>
        <p class="entry">Welcome to my website. Though it's incomplete at the moment, I'm hoping to work to make this a nice little space. This is my diary where I'll write about all sorts of things that come to mind, however since this is the first entry here I'll start by sharing a little bit about myself. My name is Emily, I'm a 26 year old trans woman living in France, I like hedgehogs and gaming and I'm a bit of an aspiring creative. I'm looking to eventually make video essays in order to express my creativity, but this website and my <a href=https://www.backloggd.com/u/MinervaFFXIV>Backloggd</a> are two other outlets for me to express myself. I like to write, though I don't think I'm very good at it. Noticing flaws in what I work on is just an excuse to improve, even if I do have a habit of beating myself up over small mistakes. <br class="noselect"><br class="noselect"> If you're still here, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to read all of this. It means a lot to me that people would care about what I have to say, even if I don't have too much *to* say. Regardless, thank you for your time. <br class="noselect"><br class="noselect"> <img src="img/friend.png" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 200px;"></p>
